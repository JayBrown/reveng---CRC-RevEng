System requirements of ARM Tube OS binary
Greg Cook, 25 March 2020

CRC RevEng has been tested on a 16MB SPROW ARM7TDMI Coprocessor running
ARM Tube OS version 0.45, with OS 1.20 on the host.  Installation on
disc is strongly recommended.
The following filing systems are known to be compatible:-

- OPUS EDOS 0.4, patched by EDOSPAT versions 4.90, 5.40 or 6.03
- Acorn DFS 2.26, as supplied with the GoMMC interface (PDFS226.BIN),
  with DFSfix installed (see below)

To load and run the ARM Tube OS binary successfully, the Disc Filing
System (DFS) on the host computer must support at least the following:
- Full 32-bit address handling within *RUN (image loading and execution)
- Ability to load images >64 KiB to the coprocessor.
- Tolerance of OSARGS calls with A=2, Y=0 (read NFS version).
- The functions performed by DFSfix must be implemented, either as
  faithful emulations of RISC OS or by translation to similar existing
  calls.

Once CRC RevEng has been loaded and executed, it can be reinvoked
without reloading the image, using *Go:-

	*reveng -h
	*Go ; -m crc-16/ibm-sdlc -c 313233343536373839

Estimated brute force search times, including loading time, and progress
report intervals on the SPROW ARM7TDMI Coprocessor are as follows:-

CRC	Codeword	*Cache On	*Cache Off
width	lengths		Runtime	Reports	Runtime	Reports
(bits)	(bytes)

32	5,5,6		    9s	     -	     9s	     -
32	8,8,7		15h06m	56m36s	120h53m	 7h33m
32	9,9,8		31h07m	58m20s	259h04m	 8h06m
64	12,11,12,12,17,	   45s	     -	  5m09s	     -
	11,12,8,9*

*First nine codewords from the CRC-64/XZ entry in the CRC Catalogue.

The ARM Tube OS binary also runs as a statically-linked image under
RISC OS, at twice the size of the RISC OS binary.

DFSfix

This is a small utility for the BBC Micro (or Master series)
computer which installs itself between the Acorn Disc Filing System
firmware (Acorn DFS) and the public filing system call points,
providing an enhanced filing system interface.
The new interface is useful to all programs, but when a simple
RISC OS program using the ANSI C Library is run on an attached Sprow
ARM7TDMI Coprocessor with its built-in ARM Tube OS firmware, DFSfix
emulates just enough of RISC OS's FileSwitch API for the program to
read and write files to Acorn DFS discs through the ARM Tube OS.

DFSfix is only for use with Acorn DFS.

To install DFSfix, enter the following (once) after pressing BREAK:

	*dfsfix

The supplied binary is assembled to reside in the sector buffer of
file handle &15.  This retains compatibility with all the BBC Micro's
facilities, as long as at most four files are opened simultaneously -
a limit seldom reached in practice.

The assembler program listing for DFSfix is included, to allow
reassembly to another base address or selection of extended features.
Assembly options are documented in the listing.
